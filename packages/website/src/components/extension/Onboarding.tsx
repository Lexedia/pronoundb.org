      <p class='mb-2'>
        Thank you for installing the extension! You'll finally no longer have to go through the trouble of reminding
        pronouns for every single person you see on the Internet! Amazing!
      </p>
      <p class='mb-6'>
        Whenever you interact with someone who uses PronounDB, you'll see their pronouns show up, so you know how to
        refer to that person. It'll also show up on people's profiles, so you can lookup people's pronouns easily.
      </p>

      <h3 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>Share your own pronouns</h3>
      <p class='mb-6'>
        You can let other people know your pronouns by {how}, linking your accounts, and pick the sets of pronouns
        you'd like people to use on you. They'll then be able to know how to refer to you as well!
      </p>

      <h3 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>Spread the word!</h3>
      <p class='mb-6'>
        This extension is only useful if people use it! The more people use it, the less people will be hesitant or
        do mistakes about your pronouns!
      </p>

      <h3 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>Rate the extension</h3>
      <p class='mb-6'>
        Enjoying the extension? You can leave a review on your extension store to let me know you're appreciating
        it. {heart}
      </p>

      <h3 class='text-xl font-bold mb-2'>Feeling generous?</h3>
      <p>
        If you wish, you can <a href={Routes.DONATE} target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' class='link'>donate</a> so I
        can buy enough cookies and coffee to stay alive! Donations help paying for the hosting of the website, which
        isn't free, unlike the extension! ðŸ¥°
